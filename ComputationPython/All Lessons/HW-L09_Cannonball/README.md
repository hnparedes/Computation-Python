# L09HW_Cannonball
Initial code for L09 HW. New features need to be added and changes to class structure.

## Description
The Python code simulates the trajectory of a cannonball using a Cannonball class. It incorporates the following key components:

- Initialization: The __init__ method initializes the cannonball's position and velocity.
- Movement: The move method updates the cannonball's position and velocity based on time and gravity.
- Position retrieval: The getX and getY methods return the current x and y positions, respectively.
- Shooting: The shoot method sets the initial velocity and angle of the cannonball and simulates its trajectory until it hits the ground.
- Visualization: The code uses Matplotlib to visualize the cannonball's path.

Will help students learn how to apply inheritance and composition to Object oriented programming.
